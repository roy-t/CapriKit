# CapriKit.Tests.Tool

A tool that guides you through manual tests that cover classes that use the Win32 and DirectX APIs that are hard to programmetically mock or verify the outcomes off.

TODO: integrate DearImGui, allow starting of multiple scenarios that guide you through several steps (minimize the window, move the cursor to the top left corner, ...) and asks the user for conformation of the effects if we can't capture them.
