Classes for working with files and directories. The `FilePath` and `DirectoryPath` classes make the intentions of APIs working with files and directories clear and reduces the need for repeated checks on the validity of the path. The `IVirtualFileSystem` makes it easier to perform common operations and to test these in-memory or put limitations on what folders an application can affect.
