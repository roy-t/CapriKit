## Goal

I have been writing code since 2003. I started in Visual Basic 6 and I switched to C# code since 2007. Since then I have written thousands of lines of code. Most of that code is half tests and sits in forgotten repositories.

With CapriKit I try to make a library where I gather all code that I find relevant and through documentation and testing I try to make it reusable and have lasting value. For myself, and maybe for others.
